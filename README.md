This is a simple set of guides for the use of the Warframe community to help teach new and experienced players new things.

## Contribution Guidelines

To commit/submit a pull request to have your changes pulled in, it will have to be:

1. Using proper markdown formatting, use the guide [here](https://help.github.com/categories/writing-on-github/).

1. In a single commit, this means you'll have to get used to squashing. Check the guide [here](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-request-merges/) if you have lots of revisions

1. You will need to include a summary of your changes along with your Discord Id (e.g., DiscordName#3333).
